## 🎯 Research Problem
How can we design, develop, and evaluate **Generative AI–based pedagogical artifacts** that support high school teachers in creating instructional activities with pedagogical quality, curricular alignment, and ethical responsibility?

---

## 🎯 General Objective

To design, develop, and evaluate pedagogical artifacts powered by Generative AI that support high school teachers in the creation of instructional activities in an effective, pedagogically grounded, and ethically responsible manner.

---

## 📌 Specific Objectives
1. Identify the needs and challenges faced by high school teachers when using Generative AI to develop instructional activities.  
2. Map pedagogical, technical, and ethical requirements for AI-supported educational artifacts.  
3. Design structured pedagogical artifacts (prompts, templates, workflows) that assist teachers in lesson and activity planning.  
4. Develop functional prototypes based on principles of Educational Software Engineering.  
5. Evaluate these artifacts in real educational contexts, analyzing effectiveness, usability, and pedagogical quality.  
6. Propose practical guidelines for the safe, ethical, and pedagogically informed use of Generative AI in K–12 education.

---

## 🧪 Methodology
The research adopts the **Design Science Research (DSR)** methodology, involving:
- Problem investigation and teacher needs analysis  
- Requirements engineering (pedagogical, technical, ethical)  
- Design and development of Generative AI–based pedagogical artifacts  
- Prototyping of workflows, prompts, and micro-tools  
- Empirical evaluation with high school teachers  
- Refinement and validation of the proposed solutions

Mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) will be used to ensure robust, evidence-based findings.

## 🧩 Artifacts Under Development
- **Pedagogical Prompt Kit for Teachers**  
- **AI-Based Instruction and Lesson Planning Workflows**  
- **Templates for Instructional Activities Aligned to Competencies and Skills**  
- **Rubrics and Evaluation Models for AI-Generated Activities**  
- **Micro-tools and scripts that assist teachers during planning**

Artifacts will be published in this repository as development progresses.
